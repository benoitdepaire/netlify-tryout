## Fauna DB

### Getting started
We followed the quick tutorial on <https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/start/cloud>. 
This required the installation of the fauna shell (`npm install -g fauna-shell`)
Next, log in to Fauna with the command `fauna cloud-login`.
To create a new database, run the command `fauna create-database my_test_db`.
But you can also just work from the browser. :)
